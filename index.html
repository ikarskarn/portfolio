                <p>For more than twenty years my passion has been to be involved in creative endeavors, such as Theatre and Music, that bring joy to others.  Over the course of my entire life I have enjoyed solving problems and finding solutions in both creative and logical ways.  For over ten years I have worked in the creative field of Game Development as a C# Engineer, Designer, 3D Modeler, 3D Rigging Engineer, Mobile Programmer, Rendering Specialist, and Educator.  In the past couple of years I have found that my passion for bringing joy to others, creativity, and problem solving skills fit well into the Web Development arena.</p>
                <p>I am excited about this new chapter in my life and the career change to Web Development.  I am a soon-to-be Graduate of the Engineering Flex Full Stack Bootcamp at Thinkful and have learned valuable tools and resources to help me make the transition to Web Development.  My experience in Game Design and Development provides me with a unique perspective on Interactivity and Design principles that encourage engagement and increase interest while maintaining an elegant functionality and responsiveness of content.  My background as an Educator makes me a master problems solver and collaborator on fast paced, highly technical projects.  My knowledge in a wide range of subjects provides me with insight into other pieces of the puzzle, which allows me the opportunity to anticipate future issues and considerations for the design and/or functionality of a project.</p>
                <p>Simply put, I think itâ€™s fun to do and I want to live my life doing what I love and can have doing it.</p>
